It does not respond purely, or even primarily, to offenders’ attitudes, and its proper targets need not be fully developed moral agents. It characteristically involves a wish for the restoration of social equilibrium rather than a demand for moral recognition or good will. To illuminate these contentions, I focus on cases that I believe demonstrate a corollary thesis, namely, that strength, broadly construed, is a necessary condition of resentment-worthiness. I argue that weakness can make resentment unfitting in two ways. First, weakness may prevent a wrongdoer from shifting the balance of social power. Second, a weak wrongdoer may do social damage but be so lowly that resentment, which would represent him as excessively strong, would be inapt. Finally, I consider how accepting the ecological view might affect our theorizing about moral responsibility and the ethics of blame.', 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '015642bd8439d739483eac606e53784d5576d571', 'title': 'Knowability Relative to Information', 'abstract': '\\n We present a formal semantics for epistemic logic, capturing the notion of knowability relative to information (KRI). Like Dretske, we move from the platitude that what an agent can know depends on her (empirical) information. We treat operators of the form (‘B is knowable on the basis of information A’) as variably strict quantifiers over worlds with a topic- or aboutness-preservation constraint. Variable strictness models the non-monotonicity of knowledge acquisition while allowing knowledge to be intrinsically stable. Aboutness-preservation models the topic-sensitivity of information, allowing us to invalidate controversial forms of epistemic closure while validating less controversial ones. Thus, unlike the standard modal framework for epistemic logic, KRI accommodates plausible approaches to the Kripke-Harman dogmatism paradox which bear on non-monotonicity or on topic-sensitivity. KRI also strikes a better balance between agent idealization and a non-trivial logic of knowledge ascriptions.', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': '0170353d01f929ebee0b47c604745c047f055054', 'title': 'Living Toward Virtue: Practical Ethics in the Spirit of Socrates', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': '0210c05a1adeebadfad09efb2ad1bca98ca84906', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '02f45cbb3c4de22d4325b4bdadde258945f1bcb7', 'title': 'Who Needs a Proof of the Principle of Non-Contradiction?', 'abstract': '\\n The topic of this paper is Aristotle’s ‘proof by refutation’ of the Principle of Non-Contradiction (Metaphysics Γ 4, 1006a11–1007a20). I consider a worry which has often been raised in connection with this proof. The worry is that, faced with an opponent who is prepared to tolerate contradictions, the argument is dialectically powerless: it is incapable of getting them to abandon their position. In reply, I argue that the proof needs to be seen in its proper context, that is, as part of Aristotle’s response to an opponent who demands a demonstration of the principle. This allows us to clarify the purpose of the argument and answer the worry about its effectiveness.', 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': '032f3e3a0f84da966f28e505c6ab7061146edab3', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '0356e3993612ad145c31acccd93d8815e3a9309d', 'title': 'Zahavi’s Husserl and the Legacy of Phenomenology: A Critical Notice of Husserl’s Legacy: Phenomenology, Metaphysics, and Transcendental Philosophy, by Dan Zahavi', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '0386e6f186eb6b181bf6901175d2b55439feae02', 'title': 'Steps of Pre-processing for English to Mizo SMT System', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '039061de02d536360a5beb60c3f5c4e07f556521', 'title': 'On the Genealogy of Universals: The Metaphysical Origins of Analytic Philosophy, by Fraser MacBride', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '03b2bf98aa2d310d88a43ac71ffeffbafbfc2a82', 'title': 'KK is Wrong Because We Say So', 'abstract': '\\n This paper offers a new argument against the KK thesis, which says that if you know p, then you know that you know p.

If KK were true, Dudley would know that he has 100 iterations of knowledge about p, and so he wouldn’t deny that he did.

Here, I examine a new challenge to these finitist arguments—namely, the challenge of implying that the future cannot be endless.

Though it’s unpopular, a flurry of considerations has recently emerged in its favour. Here we add fuel to the fire: standard resources allow us to show that any failure of KK will lead to the knowability and assertability of abominable indicative conditionals of the form ‘If I don’t know it, p’. Such conditionals are manifestly not assertable—a fact that KK defenders can easily explain. I survey a variety of KK-denying responses and find them wanting. Those who object to the knowability of such conditionals must either (i) deny the possibility of harmony between knowledge and belief, or (ii) deny well-supported connections between conditional and unconditional attitudes. Meanwhile, those who grant knowability owe us an explanation of such conditionals’ unassertability—yet no successful explanations are on offer.

But while many commentators express sympathy for his charge of foolishness, most regard his charge of futility as indefensible even within his own system. In this paper, I offer a defence of Schopenhauer’s futility charge, based on metaphysical and psychological considerations. On the metaphysical front, Schopenhauer’s view implies that psychological connections extend beyond the death of an individual. Drawing on Parfit’s discussion of personal identity, I argue that those connections have personal significance, such that suicide does not allow one, as Hamlet hopes, simply ‘not to be’. On the psychological front, I argue that a distinction between agents’ intentions and underlying desires makes room for Schopenhauer’s claim that paradigmatic suicidal agents ultimately desire the opposite of what suicide accomplishes. I conclude by showing how this understanding of futility can buttress Schopenhauer’s charge of foolishness. My interpretation still leaves Schopenhauer vulnerable to certain objections, but shows that his account is more defensible than previous commentators have realized.', 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': '05dc93d1db89ac47b58a86aa2a40b504c6fd1853', 'title': 'Not Quite Yet a Hazy Limbo of Mystery: Intuition in Russell’s An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry', 'abstract': '\\n I argue that in Bertrand Russell’s An Essay on the Foundations of Geometry (1897), his forms of externality serve the same fundamental role in grounding the possibility of geometry that Immanuel Kant’s forms of intuition serve in grounding geometry in his critical philosophy.

My proposal is that for Shepherd time has exactly one causal power: to provide for the continued existence of self-same or changing objects. Because Shepherd takes causation to be a relation whereby two objects combine to form a third, their effect, whenever we perceive a continually existing object, since time is a proper part of such objects, our perception of time is caused by time itself.

I argue that this strategy is misguided. First, explanations citing essence facts about normative properties are poor answers to the question of the source of normativity.

First (in Sects 2–7), I argued against referentialism about credence: roughly, the view that the objects of credence (that is, the entities that credence functions assign credences to) are constituted by the objects and properties that the credence is about. Second (in Sect. 8), I used this conclusion to argue against referentialism about belief: roughly, the view that the objects of belief are constituted by the objects and properties that the belief is about. Third (in Sects 9– 13), I went on to defend a positive nonreferentialist view of the objects of credence in terms of sets of epistemically possible scenarios. In ‘The Objects of Credence and Belief ’, David Braun appears to disagree vigorously with all three of these conclusions. At least on the first two points, however, there is less disagreement than meets the eye. Much depends on how referentialism is defined, which depends in turn on how the objects of credence and the objects of belief are defined. With these defined as I define them, Braun agrees with me that referentialism about credence is false. Furthermore, his view of belief (‘guise Russellianism’) is one that counts as a nonreferentialist view of belief by my lights. It is only on the third issue concerning the specific nonreferentialist view of the objects of credence that we have a clear substantive disagreement. All this takes some sorting out. One key to the sorting is that discussions of views akin to referentialism (and Russellianism) have very much focused on referentialism about language: roughly, the thesis that the linguistic content of expressions and utterances is determined by the referents (worldly extensions) of the simple expressions involved. In my paper, I largely set aside referentialism about language to focus on referentialism about mind: roughly, the view that the mental content of representational mental states (such as beliefs) is determined by the referents (worldly extensions) of the simple mental states or', 'year': 2016}, {'paperId': '1d89ef9a8b931f62f3009fbb45a037bf7d1b7bee', 'title': 'Sacrifice Regained: Morality and Self-interest in British Moral Philosophy from Hobbes to Bentham, by Roger Crisp', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '1dcb93abc12a6b0bc6c70d307f82379428555a2b', 'title': 'Medical Image Fusion Based on Deep Decomposition and Sparse Representation', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '1dd13f714586c583118f9a21622d8238401c3eec', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '1df07b0986d4b20a83bf43370d2cf3893d174a19', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '1e1544619c50e3f2774c4f2f21ad591eae17a8a7', 'title': 'Automatic Detection of Pneumonia from Chest X-Rays Using Deep Learning', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '1e3f40a75464d62a24df9753b508406f2d2cfa65', 'title': 'Vices of the Mind, by Quassim Cassam', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '1e926362ca20f7574edf04bcf387bdff59ac3564', 'title': 'Student Interests, Needs, and Preferences for Trauma-Sensitive Yoga at a Southeastern U.S. University', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': '1ed3c8a71567f37e7186d42673b7804837340d20', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': '1ef2d84603be02535288c055e65d9e6ac30e09c9', 'title': 'Sympathy in Perception, by Mark Eli Kalderon', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '1f6170e4d8718eb89a0581d2fdb6c466dba4161e', 'title': 'A Robust Technique for End Point Detection Under Practical Environment', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '1f6c65d8c272d3ecb99e0863d46bc40c3cedbc6a', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '1f99c800616b4445c4b9037903e6b7fcdf3c62b1', 'title': '5W1H-Based Semantic Segmentation of Tweets for Event Detection Using BERT', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '1fa9afc70a1f2dab34be3ad95bd1570e2995355c', 'title': 'Evidence, Judgment, and Belief at Will', 'abstract': '\\n Doxastic involuntarists have paid insufficient attention to two debates in contemporary epistemology: the permissivism debate and the debate over norms of assertion and belief.

We provide countermodels to show that regionalism does not follow from (STP), even together with fourteen potentially implicit background principles.

Fricker herself has recently moved towards paradigm-based explanation, arguing that it is a more perspicuous way of reaping the same explanatory pay-off as pragmatic genealogy while dispensing with its fictionalising and historicising. My aim is to determine when and why the reverse movement from paradigm-based explanation to pragmatic genealogy remains warranted. I argue that the fictionalising and historicising of pragmatic genealogy is well motivated, and I outline three ways in which the method earns its keep: by successfully handling historically inflected practices which paradigm-based explanation cannot handle; by revealing and arguing for connections to generic needs we might otherwise miss; and by providing comprehensive views of practices that place and relate the respects in which they serve both generic and local needs.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '3850406586110597f857fcf6db4b69bc01f37ec5', 'title': 'Against Marriage: An Egalitarian Defence of the Marriage-Free State,by Clare Chambers', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': '38691419086ecf883664eeee336eddf72e45fdb0', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': '392d6af059e55e1a3d620bcfe5fd09e42b529070', 'title': 'How to Do Without Encroachment', 'abstract': '\\n This paper defends a version of epistemic contextualism that accounts for the ordinary judgements and theoretical principles that motivate pragmatic encroachment.

The problem is that there seems to be no good answer to what property everyone who makes moral claims could be talking and thinking about. The Common Subject Problem is not a new problem; on the contrary, I will argue that it is one of the central animating concerns in the history of both metaethics and normative theory. But despite its importance, the Common Subject Problem is essentially invisible on many contemporary ways of carving up the problems of metaethics and normative ethical theory.\\n My aim, therefore, is to make progress – in part by naming the problem, but also by beginning to sketch out the contours of what gives the problem its force, by distinguishing between different paths of response to the problem and assessing some of their chief merits, and finally, by distinguishing the Common Subject Problem from another problem with which it has come to be conflated. This nearby problem is the Moral Twin Earth Problem. Whereas the Common Subject Problem is a problem about what property ‘wrong’ could refer to, the Moral Twin Earth Problem is a problem about how ‘wrong’ could refer to it.\\n The upshot of the paper, therefore, is to rescue one of the historically significant problems in normative ethics and metaethics – a problem that is essentially about normative semantics – from the illusion that has persisted over the last twenty years that it is really, somehow, a problem about metasemantics. Once we have reclaimed this problem, we can see that it could still be a problem even if there are no distinctively metasemantic problems in metaethics at all, that it is a problem faced by a wider variety of views, and that the space of possible solutions is much wider and more interesting for normative theory, moral psychology, and moral epistemology.', 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '40148975e225169b3b93ef76ccf51aa240ca7402', 'title': 'Wittgenstein on Rules.

When epistemic virtues are interpreted as ‘voters’ in charge of ranking competing theories, and there are more than two theories at stake, the final ordering is bound to coincide with the one proposed by one of the voters (the dictator), provided a number of seemingly reasonable conditions are in place. In a similar spirit, Jacob Stegenga has shown that Arrow’s theorem applies to the amalgamation of evidence; the ‘voters’ here are the different sources of evidence. As with Okasha’s proposal, it is not clear how to avoid Arrow’s pessimistic conclusion.\\n In this paper we develop a novel argument that purports to show that, in typical examples, Arrow’s result does not obtain when dealing with evidence amalgamation. The reason is that we cannot escape the well-known Duhem problem: the evidence actually confirms (or disconfirms) complex conjunctions that include various auxiliary hypotheses. We argue that confirmational holism induces us to restrict the domain of a reasonable amalgamation function, thus violating one of Arrow’s conditions. The upshot is that we are now able to see the Duhem problem under a different, positive light – namely, as a phenomenon that makes the aggregation of the evidence possible in the first place, when there are at least three options on the table.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '4314693a5defd36402742d111f259a54df3c8f0c', 'title': 'Deflecting Ockham’s Razor: A Medieval Debate about Ontological Commitment', 'abstract': '\\n William of Ockham (d. 1347) is well known for his commitment to parsimony and for his so-called ‘razor’ principle.

In particular, I consider a clever challenge that Ockham’s younger contemporary, Walter Chatton (d. 1343) deploys against the razor. The challenge involves a kind of dilemma for Ockham. Depending on how Ockham responds to this dilemma, his razor will, Chatton argues, either prove unacceptably dull when it comes to determining ontological commitment or prove unacceptably sharp when it comes to determining commitments entailed by certain theological doctrines.

The second model, like Moss’s model, is shown to be semantically and mathematically tractable. The second model, however, can be straightforwardly integrated into a plausible model of the role of graded attitudes toward modal claims in cognition and normative epistemology.', 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '47fb69962f62f3e3cd4d6f9dbe5a7a41d93a54e7', 'title': 'Experience of nature is the moderator of the positive link between pausing in wondering awe and gratitude and psychological wellbeing', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': '4889932d44d936b2c32c08a6496891f8537bbfbf', 'title': 'The role of religion in the legitimization of political decision-making processes: A comparative study of the socio-cultural aspects of secularization in Germany and Iran', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': '491a93385b158c731e512861e68070822f9bfdc2', 'title': 'Only Imagine: Fiction, Interpretation, and Imagination, by Kathleen Stock', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': '4941f360214ea91111002a724cc06e2fe0d29ea6', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '496dddb7087d60f4a0b0eb0f56e1ce99bdc09aad', 'title': 'Philosophical Progress: In Defence of a Reasonable Optimism, by Daniel Stoljar', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '4a8f878af62757d08bff8173019f78e299c59fbb', 'title': 'Why Be Random?', 'abstract': '\\n When does it make sense to act randomly? A persuasive argument from Bayesian decision theory legitimizes randomization essentially only in tie-breaking situations. Rational behaviour in humans, non-human animals, and artificial agents, however, often seems indeterminate, even random. Moreover, rationales for randomized acts have been offered in a number of disciplines, including game theory, experimental design, and machine learning. A common way of accommodating some of these observations is by appeal to a decision-maker’s bounded computational resources. Making this suggestion both precise and compelling is surprisingly difficult. Toward this end, I propose two fundamental rationales for randomization, drawing upon diverse ideas and results from the wider theory of computation. The first unifies common intuitions in favour of randomization from the aforementioned disciplines.

On the one hand, we care about getting things right. Our attempts at aesthetic judgments aim at correctness. On the other hand, we demand autonomy. We want appreciators to arrive at their aesthetic judgments through their own cognitive efforts, rather than through deferring to experts. These two demands seem to be in tension; after all, if we want to get the right judgments, we should defer to the judgments of experts. How can we resolve this tension? The best explanation, I suggest, is that aesthetic appreciation is something like a game. When we play a game, we try to win. But often, winning isn’t the point; playing is. Aesthetic appreciation involves the same flipped motivational structure: we aim at the goal of correctness, but having correct judgments isn’t the point. The point is the engaged process of interpreting, investigating, and exploring the aesthetic object. When one defers to aesthetic testimony, then, one makes the same mistake as when one looks up the answer to a puzzle, rather than solving it for oneself. The shortcut defeats the whole point. This suggests a new account of aesthetic value: the engagement account. The primary value of the activity of aesthetic appreciation lies in the process of trying to generate correct judgments, and not in having correct judgments.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '4e12735e970236a9902581b28d3e2bc3f89f576e', 'title': 'Optimization of Local Ordering Technique for Nearest Neighbour Circuits', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '4f922ac86f84ed3b18faea46bf26a9be9f314c25', 'title': 'Infinity, Causation, and Paradox, by Alexander Pruss', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '4fc5957d1a8748899bf2c7599ccfab928ef201d8', 'title': 'Learning from Conditionals', 'abstract': '\\n In this article, we address a major outstanding question of probabilistic Bayesian epistemology: how should a rational Bayesian agent update their beliefs upon learning an indicative conditional?

Kant's position, as I interpret it, challenges the contemporary trends that define emotions in terms of other mental states and defines them instead first and foremost as ‘feelings’. Although Kant's views on the nature of feelings have drawn surprisingly little attention, I argue that the faculty of feeling has the distinct role of making us aware of the way our faculties relate to each other and to the world. As I show, feelings are affective appraisals of our activity, and as such they play an indispensable orientational function in the Kantian mind. After spelling out Kant's distinction between feeling and desire (§2), I turn to the distinction between feeling and cognition (§3) and show that while feelings are non-cognitive states, they have a form of derived-intentionality. §4 argues that what feelings are about, in this derived sense, is our relationship to ourselves and the world: they function as affective appraisals of the state of our agency. §5 shows that this function is necessary to the activity of the mind insofar as it is orientational. Finally, §6 discusses the examples of epistemic pleasure and moral contentment and argues that they manifest the conditions of cognitive and moral agency respectively.\", 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': '63c0406420ff9ccd4ab56e49a1a68c4439de9a60', 'title': 'Transparency and Reflection: A Study of Self-Knowledge and the Nature of Mind, by Matthew Boyle', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': '63c7c3d0f92330f84dc744ae9d285a842c64e886', 'title': 'Handwritten Bengali Character Recognition Using Deep Convolution Neural Network', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '6452f14619357bb9203ad86f34f7d81c80c186af', 'title': 'The Limits of Blame, by Erin I.

His first book, When Words Are Called For: A Defense of Ordinary Language Philosophy (2012) adopted a therapeutic approach (in the Wittgensteinian style) to problems in contemporary epistemology, arguing that when properly thought through, the way philosophers talk about ‘knowing’ that something is the case ultimately does not make sense. Baz’s goal in his second book is less therapeutic and more constructive: he aims to start a methodological revolution (in the Kuhnian sense)—to shake contemporary philosophers out of the unconscious habits of normal science and provoke them into making a radical change in the methods they use to do philosophy and the basic assumptions that motivate those methods. The ‘crisis’ in the title of Baz’s book is supposed to apply to the so-called ‘method of cases’. The method of cases is an approach to investigating the concepts that are the meanings of expressions like ‘intentionally’, ‘deliberately’, and ‘knows’, or the properties those concepts represent, such as doing something intentionally, or doing something deliberately, or knowing that something is the case. The method involves considering whether real or imagined cases (situations, scenarios, etc.) fall within the extension of the concept being investigated, or equivalently, whether the concept ‘applies’ to those cases. The method of cases can be practiced from the armchair. For example, do the words ‘intentionally’ and ‘deliberately’ mean the same thing? One way to begin to answer that question is to see whether it is ever possible to accurately describe an action as being done intentionally, but not deliberately, or vice-versa. If it is, then that is evidence that the words have different extensions, and therefore have different meanings. J.L. Austin was an artful armchair practitioner of the method of cases. For example, Austin imagines a situation in which he is rushing to ‘quell a riot’, sees his servant’s child’s go-cart in the middle of the road, and runs over it with his car because there is no time to move it. He says that this is a case of doing something—running over the go-cart—deliberately, but not intentionally, because he never intended to run over it (Austin, 1966, p. 432). The method of cases can also be practiced using the experimental methods of the cognitive sciences. A philosopher worried about the limitations of her own parochial judgments about cases might ask lecture halls of undergraduates or pay hundreds of Amazon Mechanical Turk workers to consider cases such as Austin’s go-cart case to see how ‘ordinary’ people apply the expressions ‘deliberately’ and ‘intentionally’ (or the translations of those expressions in other languages) to various actions. Some informative, statistically significant patterns of application might show up in the resulting responses that support or challenge thinking of the meanings of ‘intentionally’ and ‘deliberately’ in certain ways. It might turn out, for example, that most ordinary people don’t apply ‘deliberately’ and ‘intentionally’ to', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': '733f02bb525cfe4f93df1f547dda24eccd5ef986', 'title': 'Philosophical Essays East and West: Agent-Based Virtue Ethics and other topics at the intersection of Chinese thought and Western analytic philosophy, by Michael Slote', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2025}, {'paperId': '73f9678497f72d781ebdce4d3d90048e636d699e', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '7514c00911596a56dbb092dd85abfc0f036b750c', 'title': 'Unknowable Colour Facts', 'abstract': '\\n It is common for an object to present different colour appearances to different perceivers, even when the perceivers and viewing conditions are normal.

Ecumenism: both experiences are veridical. Nihilism: both experiences are non-veridical. Inegalitarianism: one experience is veridical and the other is non-veridical. Perhaps the most important objection to inegalitarianism is the ignorance objection, according to which inegalitarianism should be rejected because it is committed to the existence of unknowable colour facts (for example, facts about which objects are unique green). The goal of this paper is to show that ecumenists are also committed to unknowable colour facts.

Nonetheless, there is reason to think that such a strong form of idealism is indeed correct. In this paper, I will present an argument for idealism of this kind through considerations about a harmony between our thought and reality. The central argument in favour of idealism will come from a possibly unexpected source: we can see that a strong form of idealism is true simply from considerations about our language alone. I shall argue that thinking about how we represent reality allows us to conclude that idealism is true, and thus that reality must be a certain way. But no argument of this kind seems to allow for a metaphysical conclusion like idealism, since considerations about our language alone only show how we represent reality, not how reality is. And thus idealism can’t possibly follow, since it concerns how reality is, not just how we represent it to be.

If not, we’d have two competing representations and systems of prediction and explanation, a dubious dualism. Many might then reject one of the two pictures, yet neither can be jettisoned lightly. Folk psychology structures daily life, and decision theory pervades various scientific disciplines. I’m interested in accounting for two central folk psychological concepts—believing and wanting—with decision theory. Many have attempted this task for believing.

In cases of overdetermination, an action can cause a good outcome without the latter counterfactually depending on the former. In cases of constitution, an action can constitute a good outcome rather than causing it. And in cases of determinism, either the laws or the past counterfactually depend on your action, even though your action cannot cause the laws or the past to be different.

In this interpretation of the comparisons, I present a progressively more restrictive account of Spinoza’s views about the nature of human beings in the Ethics and show at each step how those views inform the account of states in the Political Treatise. Because, like human beings, states are individuals, they strive to persevere in existence. Because, like human beings, states are composed of parts that are individuals, states' parts also strive to persevere in being. Finally, because in states, as in human beings, a change to the power of striving of a part can be at the same time a change to the whole that differs in kind, strong states can be bad for their citizens and states that serve their citizens well may nevertheless be weak. Spinoza’s principal project in the Political Treatise is to design states that are stable and good for their citizens.

Second, they employ recombination or patchwork principles to argue that paradoxical situations would be possible if causal finitism were false.

Rather, such an agent can aggregate the theories in which she has positive credence by methods borrowed from voting theory—specifically, MacAskill suggests, by a kind of weighted Borda count. The appeal to voting methods opens up a promising new avenue for theories of rational choice under normative uncertainty. The Borda rule, however, is open to at least two serious objections. First, it seems implicitly to ‘cardinalize’ ordinal theories, and so does not fully face up to the problem of merely ordinal theories. Second, the Borda rule faces a problem of option individuation. MacAskill attempts to solve this problem by invoking a measure on the set of practical options. But it is unclear that there is any natural way of defining such a measure that will not make the output of the Borda rule implausibly sensitive to irrelevant empirical features of decision-situations. After developing these objections, I suggest an alternative: the McKelvey uncovered set, a Condorcet method that selects all and only the maximal options under a strong pairwise defeat relation. This decision rule has several advantages over Borda and mostly avoids the force of MacAskill’s objection to Condorcet methods in general.', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': '8cd5e5f0048c8ad2eabc9e2d9ff5f58ab2eba861', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': '8db16640fbf7ff07638c8b77ea4197b44969dcd5', 'title': 'Thin Objects: An Abstractionist Account, by Øystein Linnebo', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '8e1aaf88c633040d7913e9f88886c1210e90401e', 'title': 'The Failures of Philosophy: A Historical Essay, by Stephen Gaukroger', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': '8e363c125e0d7d1f2b93c73df26179b1a0d72ec5', 'title': 'The Fifth Corner of Four: An Essay on Buddhist Metaphysics and the Catuṣkoṭi\\n , by Graham Priest', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '8e53422293621ebd80e1aaaeb15b7aa7ef9144cf', 'title': 'Single Look SAR Image Segmentation Using Local Entropy, Median Low-Pass Filter and Fuzzy Inference System', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': '8f8913f260106ab29b1f2e83df5b7aeaeda8a78f', 'title': 'Trespassing Testimony in Scientific Collaboration', 'abstract': '\\n The term ‘epistemic trespassing’ has recently been coined to denote a person’s judgments regarding a domain where they are not epistemic experts.

Therefore, the interpretation is unified, and hence not only intuitive but also parsimonious.

Williamson (2007) has argued from a related symmetry principle to the failure of probabilistic regularity. We contend that these arguments fail, because they rely on auxiliary assumptions about probability which are inconsistent with symmetry to begin with. We argue, moreover, that symmetry should be rejected in light of this inconsistency, and because it has implausible decision-theoretic implications. The weaker principle of probabilistic invariance says that the probabilistic comparison of any two regions is unchanged by rotations of the sphere. This principle supports a more compelling argument for imprecise probability. We show, however, that invariance is incompatible with mundane judgements about what is probable.

To the traditional question that has dominated the debate — under what conditions does belief amount to knowledge? — they have added questions about testimony, epistemic virtues and vices, epistemic trust, and more. This broadening of the range of epistemic concern has coincided with an expansion in conceptions of epistemic agency beyond the individualism characteristic of most earlier epistemology. We believe that these developments have not gone far enough. While the weak anti-individualism we see in contemporary epistemology may be adequate for the kinds of cases it tends to focus on, a great deal of human knowledge production and transmission does not conform to these models. Furthermore, the dispositions and norms that are knowledge-conducive in the familiar cases may not be knowledge-conducive generally. In fact, dispositions that, at an individual level, count as epistemic vices may be epistemic virtues in common social contexts. We argue that this overlooked feature of human social life means that epistemology must become more deeply and pervasively social.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'a95c33d53b4d25838b9996493bd441b2fff7388a', 'title': 'Death and Nonexistence', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'a9af2bc8781cec6dd144770b962cfc749d7c70bf', 'title': 'The Foundations of Modality: From Propositions to Possible Worlds, by Peter Fritz', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': 'a9d94cbe100c83bc1f7e0190ca22a8c328a0f94f', 'title': 'The Reduction of Necessity to Essence', 'abstract': '\\n In ‘Essence and Modality’, Kit Fine (1994) proposes that for a proposition to be metaphysically necessary is for it to be true in virtue of the nature of all objects.

Fine himself has offered his most elaborate defence of the thesis in the context of LE. His defence rests on the widely shared assumption that metaphysical necessity obeys the laws of the modal logic S5. In order to get S5 for metaphysical necessity, he assumes a controversial principle about the nature of all objects. I will show that the addition of this principle to his original system E5 leads to inconsistency with an independently plausible principle about essence. In response, I develop a theory that avoids this inconsistency while allowing us to maintain S5 for metaphysical necessity. However, I conclude that our investigation of Fine’s Thesis in the context of LE motivates the revisionary conclusion that metaphysical necessity obeys the principles of the modal logic S4, but not those of S5. I argue that this constitutes a distinctively essentialist challenge to the received view that the logic of metaphysical necessity is S5.', 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'aa6a46c84cbdc74f8d471784f64227ab9f2c92f3', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': 'aa762fab38c885b29ddea1c0039ae2f6ebf5240f', 'title': 'The Metaphysics of Margaret Cavendish and Anne Conway: Monism, Vitalism, and Self-Motion, by Marcy P.

I first present what he takes to be the leading problem of epistemology, which he designates as the ‘problem of transcendence’ or the problem of how ‘transcendent cognition’ is possible. I then give an account of what I call his Non-Transcendence Constraint, on which the problem cannot be solved by means of cognitions of the kind whose possibility it concerns, and so cannot be solved by means of transcendent cognition. Pointing out that he provides four specifications of the problem, I go on to argue that on the most fundamental of these it concerns the general possibility of fallible cognition. By the Non-Transcendence Constraint, however, this entails that the problem of transcendence cannot be solved by means of fallible cognition.

Here we bring good news: if we accept an independently motivated version of epistemic instrumentalism—the view that epistemic reasons are a species of instrumental reasons—we can reduce The Combinatorial Problem to the relatively benign problem of how to weigh different instrumental reasons against each other.

The upshot of §2 is that the doubts raised up to the Third Meditation do not apply to the distinct metaphysical perceptions of the intellect, and in particular do not apply to the premises of the proof of the existence of God. I present the role of God as primarily to secure clear and distinct perceptions beyond the intellect, and knowledge of conclusions when those conclusions are no longer being clearly and distinctly perceived (§3.1).

As Anscombe recognised, accepting this view involves rejecting certain basic orthodox epistemological assumptions.

For while practical knowledge would appear to be a kind of propositional knowledge, intentions would appear to be a kind of non-propositional attitude. I call this the ‘Structural Challenge’ for an intention-based account of practical knowledge. After rejecting two suggested responses – one which views intentions as propositional attitudes; one which views practical knowledge as non-propositional knowledge – I offer my own solution by showing how simply having and carrying out an intention to φ will ordinarily meet a plausible neutral condition on propositional knowledge. Knowing a fact will in general involve being mentally related to it via a successful exercise of relevant concepts. The account I develop turns on viewing a person’s carrying out an intention to φ as their constituting the fact that they are φ-ing, through a practical exercise of their concept of φ-ing.

Elizabeth Barnes, focusing on physical disabilities, argues that disability is a social category. It depends on the rules undergirding the judgements of the disability rights movement. Barnes’ account may strike many as implausible. I articulate the unease, in the form of three worries about Barnes’ account. It does not fully explain why the disability rights movement is constituted in such a way that it only picks out paradigmatic disability traits, nor why only the traits identiﬁed by the movement as constituting experiences of social and political constraint count as disability. It also leaves out the contribution of people other than disability activists, to the deﬁnition of disability. I develop Barnes’ account. On my account, a person is disabled if she is in some state which is constitutive of some constraint on her legitimate interests. This state must be the subject of legitimate medical interest and be picked out by the disability rights movement as among the traits for which they are seeking to promote progress and change. My account addresses the worries about Barnes’ account. It is also able to include all disabilities, rather than only physical ones. share, include 9 causing chronic pain…requiring use of mobility aids or assistive technology; requiring medical care 9 (Barnes 2016 , p. 45 ). The inclusion of these traits appears to indicate that Barnes may be amenable to the inclusion of the role of medical interest in determining what counts as disability.

These three notions will emerge through examination of three central figures in the period: Locke (for quantitative infinity), Descartes (ontic infinity), and Leibniz (iterative infinity).', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': 'd0cd8c3963dda8e3be61d5e239b70e91da61dfb3', 'title': 'Recasting Hume and Early Modern Philosophy: Selected Essays, by Paul Russell', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2022}, {'paperId': 'd10bb4d0521718fd39ebe956c6707285e5c2c74c', 'title': 'Face Recognition Based on Human Sketches Using Fuzzy Minimal Structure Oscillation in the SIFT Domain', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'd1d663fcae264b16a77841e1d1a694ca2c0a12a9', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'd2826e37c5a1e799c195e033fa7d7faec1a9759b', 'title': 'Hilary Putnam on Logic and Mathematics, edited by Geoffrey Hellman and Roy T.

This paper takes a measurement-theoretic approach to answering this question. To make sense of adding well-being, we would need to identify some natural ‘concatenation’ operation on the bearers of well-being that satisfies the axioms of extensive measurement and can therefore be represented by the arithmetic operation of addition. I explore various proposals along these lines, involving the concatenation of segments within lives over time, of entire lives led alongside one another or in sequence, and of evaluatively basic propositions via conjunction. All of these proposals turn out to carry highly controversial commitments about the good. I do not claim that these commitments are unacceptable. But they suggest that we cannot simply take for granted, as many philosophers do, that there is any such thing as the sum of well-being.', 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'd70beba6018b2133cbc4279209330920830ffb2a', 'title': 'Convolutional Neural Network Based Sound Recognition Methods for Detecting Presence of Amateur Drones in Unauthorized Zones', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'd71f54f7ecf4adb4ac2e4107ac5b8ba01436b4b6', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'd76fa9c7854e1e9420e5dc39b4e807f96aa7dbf6', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'd833bbffa6f8972f0d79cdb1e21574dfa1a960af', 'title': 'Six Roles for Inclination', 'abstract': '\\n Initially, you judge that p.

But how should we conduct this enterprise? One increasingly popular answer to this question proposes that conceptual engineering should proceed in terms of the functions of our representational devices. In this paper, we argue that the best way of understanding this suggestion is in terms of normative functions, where normative functions of concepts are, roughly, things that they allow us to do that matter normatively (for example, things in virtue of which we have normative reasons to have these concepts). Not only does this introduce a novel view about functions to the literature. This proposal also fits more naturally than the alternatives with conceptual engineering as a normative enterprise, and it allows functions to play all of the explanatory roles assigned to them in the conceptual engineering literature. Our discussion of the explanatory advantages of normative functions also advances the understanding of the ways in which concepts can be authoritative, what this means for conceptual engineering, and highlights the importance of political philosophy for thinking about conceptual engineering in practice. Furthermore, the paper explicates what kind of role considerations about function can and should actually play in conceptual engineering.', 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': 'd9b9e4104e9248612f6e9e1a409dbb1b97707e9b', 'title': 'Defeaters and Disqualifiers', 'abstract': \"\\n Justification depends on context: even if E on its own justifies H, still it might fail to justify in the context of D. This sort of effect, epistemologists think, is due to defeaters, which undermine or rebut a would-be justifier. I argue that there is another fundamental sort of contextual feature, disqualification, which doesn't involve rebuttal or undercutting, and which cannot be reduced to any notion of screening-off. A disqualifier makes some would-be justifier otiose, as direct testimony sometimes does to distal testimony, and as manifestly decisive evidence might do to gratuitous evidence on the same team. Basing a belief on disqualified evidence, moreover, is distinctively irrational. One is not necessarily irresponsible. Instead one is turning down a free upgrade to a sleeker, stabler basis for one's beliefs. Such an upgrade would prevent wastes of epistemic effort, since someone who bases her belief on a disqualified proposition E will need to remember E and rethink her belief should E ever be defeated. The upgrade might also reduce reliance on unwieldy evidence, if E is relevant only thanks to some labyrinthine argument; and if even ideal agents should doubt their ability to follow such arguments, even they should care about disqualifiers.\", 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': 'd9d1379ee3442eeabaed988be30009a34fc93959', 'title': 'Moral Criticism and Structural Injustice', 'abstract': \"\\n Moral agency is limited, imperfect, and structurally constrained. This is evident in the many ways we all unwittingly participate in widespread injustice through our everyday actions, which I call ‘structural wrongs’. To do justice to these facts, I argue that we should distinguish between summative and formative moral criticism. While summative criticism functions to conclusively assess an agent's performance relative to some benchmark, formative criticism aims only to improve performance in an ongoing way. I show that the negative sanctions associated with summative responses are only justifiably imposed under certain conditions when persons exercise their agency wrongly — conditions that do not always hold for structural wrongs. Yet even in such cases we can still use formative responses, which are warranted whenever agents fall short of moral ideals. Expanding our repertoire of moral criticism to include both summative and formative responses enables us to better appreciate both the powers and limitations of our agency, and the complexity of moral life.\", 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'd9f290beed270a40bdb22a8c4e4cbdaf1430717a', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'd9f6b20fc65330b8e05adccbbbc484d9face446f', 'title': 'Authority Without the Duty to Obey', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'da58589f354eae7b1c236786a43f7e0db3c31106', 'title': 'Foundation of the Entire Wissenschaftslehre and Related Writings (1794-95), by Johann Gottlieb Fichte, ed. and trans.

On the first, these laws are unconditional norms for how we ought to think, and will govern anything that counts as thinking. On the second, these laws are formal criteria for being a thought, and violating them makes a putative thought not a thought. These traditions are in tension, in so far as the first depends on the possibility of thoughts that violate these laws, and the second makes violation impossible. In this essay I develop an interpretation of Kant’s pure general logic that overcomes this tension. It accounts for the possibility of logical mistakes, as the first tradition does, while still establishing the absolute impossibility of logical aliens, as the second tradition does. I then argue that the formalist insight that illogical exercises of the understanding are not alternative ways coherent thoughts could have been, but are mere confusions, is fundamental for achieving a proper understanding of the absolute normativity of the laws of pure general logic.', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': 'dd089779c6941cccdace8975956fcdfef47c7295', 'title': 'Moral Philosophy or Unphilosophic Morals?: A Critical Notice of Early Greek Ethics, edited by David Conan Wolfsdorf', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'dd40faf85c188418a8ddd7381f7e673301bc02f3', 'title': 'Levinas’s Ethical Politics, by Michael L.

This result has been taken to rule out relative overlap as a foundation for a probabilistic explication of coherence. The present paper shows that this view is premature: we propose a relative overlap measure that does not fall victim to the two properties. The guiding idea is to employ a well-established recipe for the construction of coherence measures and to adapt it to the idea of relative overlap. We show that this new measure keeps up with, or even outperforms, former overlap measures in a set of desiderata for coherence measures and a collection of popular test cases. This result re-establishes relative overlap as a candidate for a proper formalization of coherence.', 'year': 2018}, {'paperId': 'df33f6e4d0c71ca1c9909fcc57523546e3c9ed9f', 'title': 'Frege: The Pure Business of Being True, by Charles Travis', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'df4901210561ee58fa1704a0687c39f4de65325f', 'title': 'A Relationist Theory of Intentional Identity', 'abstract': '\\n This essay argues for a relationist treatment of intentional identity sentences like (1):\\n (1) Hob believes that a witch blighted Bob’s mare and Nob believes that she killed Cob’s sow.\\n According to relationism, facts of the form a believes that ϕ and b believes that ψ are not in general reducible to facts of the form c believes that χ.

I show that the general thesis of relationism can be directly motivated via cases already discussed in the literature, and then develop a particular version of relationism couched in the possible worlds framework. The resulting theory avoids the problems facing its non-relationist rivals, and yields a natural account of the truth conditions of (1), truth conditions which can be generated in a compositional manner by a version of dynamic semantics.

First, QDIs are the type of mental state central to inquiry, not attitudes like curiosity or wonder. Second, holding a QDI towards a question and acting in service of it constitutes the start of inquiry. Third, controversial norms which mandate a rational inquirer’s ignorance towards the answer to her question can be reformulated and defended by appeal to rational constraints on intention. Fourth, instrumental pressures inquirers face are the standard pressures of plan-rationality.

Finally, the semantics provides a construction procedure for transforming any truth conditional semantics for modals into a dynamic semantics for modals with similar properties.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'e986441dabdc23c278f4c93d01379e2baace0935', 'title': 'Knowing Science, by Alexander Bird', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'ea374985e24f60bbfb532f0d3b44cfceb111c926', 'title': 'The Roots of Normativity, by Joseph Raz', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'ea661dd3c3a691176f5789ed4493fcc851c0f56d', 'title': 'Life and Death in Early Modern Philosophy', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2023}, {'paperId': 'ea878d8eca2eaf33726fa165fac0d77ca86c0484', 'title': 'Deep Detection of Anomalies in Static Attributed Graph', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'eb2982a517f626947054e167f49611a443d98d0c', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'eb3c8eff9016bb237fe7982b96a06242a29af8ce', 'title': 'OUP accepted manuscript', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2021}, {'paperId': 'ec48293fea8918f383f64960ff494f40145bbc56', 'title': 'Why Does Inequality Matter?, by T.M.

In the context of his pragmatic anthropology, Kant is concerned not only to describe this form of mental activity as a fact of human psychology, but more importantly, to criticize and discourage it. But must we share Kant’s negative evaluation? Could fantasy play a positive role in some kinds of experience? In this paper I first reconstruct Kant’s conception of fantasy, and then consider what role fantasy might play in aesthetic experience. Precisely because of his anxieties about fantasy, Kant is careful to distinguish between the lawless freedom of the imagination in fantasy and the ‘free lawfulness’ of the imagination in aesthetic judgment. Departing from Kant, and with help from Susan Sontag, I argue that certain aesthetic objects, especially certain works of modernist art, positively invite fantasy, making fantasy part of proper aesthetic appreciation. I conclude by suggesting that while fantasy can indeed play a positive role in aesthetic appreciation, there is still reason to regard fantasy as ‘normatively ambiguous’.', 'year': 2024}, {'paperId': 'eef306d5ad0b2fa258fa2f5a3ac6c033d3930284', 'title': 'Name Index', 'abstract': None, 'year': 2020}, {'paperId': 'f13c951d16bc08696c014d7e54c116cbb832a9c9', 'title': 'Rational Requirements and the Primacy of Pressure', 'abstract': \"\\n There are at least two threads in our thought and talk about rationality, both practical and theoretical. In one sense, to be rational is to respond correctly to the reasons one has. Call this substantive rationality. In another sense, to be rational is to be coherent, or to have the right structural relations hold between one's attitudinal mental states, independently of whether those states are justified. Call this structural rationality. According to the standard view, structural rationality is associated with a distinctive set of requirements that mandate or prohibit certain combinations of attitudes, and it's in virtue of violating these requirements that incoherent agents are irrational. I think the standard view is mistaken. The goal of this paper is to explain why, and to motivate an alternative account: rather than corresponding to a set of law-like requirements, structural rationality should be seen as corresponding to a distinctive kind of pro tanto rational pressure—that is, something that comes in degrees, having both magnitude and direction. Something similar is standardly assumed to be true of substantive rationality. On the resulting picture, each dimension of rational evaluation is associated with a distinct kind of rational pressure—substantive rationality with (what I call) justificatory pressure and structural rationality with attitudinal pressure. The former is generated by one's reasons while the latter is generated by one's attitudes. Requirements turn out to be at best a footnote in the theory of rationality.\", 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'f1463e2275fc9e059b4ff3f1bce2adc644cd7cb7', 'title': 'Practical Knowledge and Luminosity', 'abstract': '\\n Many philosophers hold that if an agent acts intentionally, she must know what she is doing. Although the scholarly consensus for many years was to reject the thesis in light of presumed counterexamples by Donald Davidson, several scholars have recently argued that attention to aspectual distinctions and the practical nature of this knowledge shows that these counterexamples fail. In this paper I defend a new objection against the thesis, one modelled after Timothy Williamson’s anti-luminosity argument. Since this argument relies on general principles about the nature of knowledge rather than on intuitions about fringe cases, the recent responses that have been given to defuse the force of Davidson’s objection are silent against it. Moreover, the argument suggests that even weaker theses connecting practical entities (e.g. basic actions, intentions, attempts, etc.) with knowledge are also false. Recent defenders of the thesis that there is a necessary connection between knowledge and intentional action are motivated by the insight that this connection is non-accidental. I close with a positive proposal to account for the non-accidentality of this link without appeal to necessary connections by drawing an extended analogy between practical and perceptual knowledge.', 'year': 2019}, {'paperId': 'f1b6fdc7dc5fda8639359703a5d70f4078c75bd0', 'title': 'How to Solve the Puzzle of Dion and Theon Without Losing Your Head', 'abstract': 'The ancient puzzle of Dion and Theon has given rise to a surprising array of apparently implausible views. For example, in order to solve the puzzle, several philosophers have been led to deny the existence of their own feet, others have denied that objects can gain and lose parts, and large numbers of philosophers have embraced the thesis that distinct objects can occupy the same space, having all their material parts in common. In this paper, I argue for an alternative approach: I claim that human beings have ordinary parts—hands, heads, feet, and so on—but no extraordinary parts, such as ‘foot-complements’, the existence of which is essential to the puzzle. I rebut three objections to this approach: an objection that it is unacceptably metaphysically arbitrary, an objection that the view is incompatible with versions of the puzzle involving decapitation, and an objection concerning masses of matter. If we can believe that there are such things as hands and feet without involving ourselves in paradox, and without accepting large numbers of co-located material objects that share all their material parts, then that is what we should do.

For example, a Munsell chip might look unique green to you and yellowish green to me in normal viewing conditions. In such cases, there are three possibilities. Ecumenism: both experiences are veridical. Nihilism: both experiences are non-veridical. Inegalitarianism: one experience is veridical and the other is non-veridical. Perhaps the most important objection to inegalitarianism is the ignorance objection, according to which inegalitarianism should be rejected because it is committed to the existence of unknowable colour facts (for example, facts about which objects are unique green). The goal of this paper is to show that ecumenists are also committed to unknowable colour facts. More specifically, I argue that, with the exception of colour eliminativism, all major philosophical theories of colour are committed to unknowable colour facts.\",\n          \"\\n What degree of justification should be required of epistemological cognition, the kind of cognition by which epistemological problems are to be solved? I consider the question by examining Husserl\\u2019s view of the matter. Challenging the current consensus, I argue that he is committed to the infallibility of epistemological cognition. I first present what he takes to be the leading problem of epistemology, which he designates as the \\u2018problem of transcendence\\u2019 or the problem of how \\u2018transcendent cognition\\u2019 is possible. I then give an account of what I call his Non-Transcendence Constraint, on which the problem cannot be solved by means of cognitions of the kind whose possibility it concerns, and so cannot be solved by means of transcendent cognition. Pointing out that he provides four specifications of the problem, I go on to argue that on the most fundamental of these it concerns the general possibility of fallible cognition. By the Non-Transcendence Constraint, however, this entails that the problem of transcendence cannot be solved by means of fallible cognition. I conclude that central aspects of Husserl\\u2019s metaepistemology commit him to the infallibility of epistemological cognition, at least as far as solving the supposedly leading problem of epistemology is concerned.\",\n          \"\\n In this paper I respond to Marcello Di Bello\\u2019s criticisms of the \\u2018normic account\\u2019 of the criminal standard of proof (Di Bello 2019).

For example, a Munsell chip might look unique green to you and yellowish green to me in normal viewing conditions. In such cases, there are three possibilities. Ecumenism: both experiences are veridical. Nihilism: both experiences are non-veridical. Inegalitarianism: one experience is veridical and the other is non-veridical. Perhaps the most important objection to inegalitarianism is the ignorance objection, according to which inegalitarianism should be rejected because it is committed to the existence of unknowable colour facts (for example, facts about which objects are unique green). The goal of this paper is to show that ecumenists are also committed to unknowable colour facts. More specifically, I argue that, with the exception of colour eliminativism, all major philosophical theories of colour are committed to unknowable colour facts.\",\n          \"\\n What degree of justification should be required of epistemological cognition, the kind of cognition by which epistemological problems are to be solved? I consider the question by examining Husserl\\u2019s view of the matter. Challenging the current consensus, I argue that he is committed to the infallibility of epistemological cognition. I first present what he takes to be the leading problem of epistemology, which he designates as the \\u2018problem of transcendence\\u2019 or the problem of how \\u2018transcendent cognition\\u2019 is possible. I then give an account of what I call his Non-Transcendence Constraint, on which the problem cannot be solved by means of cognitions of the kind whose possibility it concerns, and so cannot be solved by means of transcendent cognition. Pointing out that he provides four specifications of the problem, I go on to argue that on the most fundamental of these it concerns the general possibility of fallible cognition. By the Non-Transcendence Constraint, however, this entails that the problem of transcendence cannot be solved by means of fallible cognition. I conclude that central aspects of Husserl\\u2019s metaepistemology commit him to the infallibility of epistemological cognition, at least as far as solving the supposedly leading problem of epistemology is concerned.\",\n          \"\\n In this paper I respond to Marcello Di Bello\\u2019s criticisms of the \\u2018normic account\\u2019 of the criminal standard of proof (Di Bello 2019).
